# Simple Rust Shell Project

This project is a simple shell implemented in Rust. It's designed to provide a basic understanding of how a shell works. The shell can execute basic commands, handle input/output redirection, and manage background processes. It's a great starting point for anyone interested in systems programming, and it showcases the power and safety features of Rust.

Please note that this is a learning project and may not have the full functionality of a production-level shell.
